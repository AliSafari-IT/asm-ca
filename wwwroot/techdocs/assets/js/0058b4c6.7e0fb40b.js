For example, to say that the value of ageOne is less than the value of ageTwo, JSON-Schema is unable to validate that and the most it can do for us is that these are both numbers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"outlines/devtools/dataformats/msgpack-lite/csharp-example":{"id":"outlines/devtools/dataformats/msgpack-lite/csharp-example","title":"Using MessagePack in .Net ","description":"HHere\'s an example of how to use MessagePack in .NET Core 3.1 or later with C# using the MessagePack NuGet package:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"outlines/devtools/dataformats/msgpack-lite/msgpack":{"id":"outlines/devtools/dataformats/msgpack-lite/msgpack","title":"MessagePack data format","description":"A binary-based data serialization format that is designed to be fast and compact.

These tools can include code editors, integrated development environments (IDEs), version control systems, debuggers, compilers, and testing frameworks. They are designed to make the development process more efficient and effective, by providing features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, error checking, and automation of repetitive tasks. Developer tools can be specific to a particular programming language or technology stack, or they can be more general-purpose tools that work across multiple languages and platforms.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"outlines/devtools/languages/opp":{"id":"outlines/devtools/languages/opp","title":"Object-oriented programming","description":"A programming language is a set of rules and instructions that are used to write computer programs.
