## XML Overview
XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a markup language designed to store and transport data in a structured format. It allows you to describe the structure and content of a document or data source using tags and attributes.

### Key Concepts

- **Tags and Attributes**: In XML, data is enclosed within tags, which define the meaning and context of the data. For instance, tags can specify whether the enclosed data is a person's name, address, or phone number. Tags can also be nested to create hierarchical data structures.
- **Extensibility**: XML is highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom tags and attributes tailored to specific applications or domains. This flexibility makes XML a versatile tool for representing complex data structures.
