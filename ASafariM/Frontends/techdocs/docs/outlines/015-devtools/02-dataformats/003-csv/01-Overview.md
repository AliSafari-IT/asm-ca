## CSV Overview

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple and widely used text-based format for representing tabular data. In a CSV file, each line corresponds to a record, and each field within a record is separated by a comma. This format is commonly used for data exchange between systems due to its simplicity and compatibility with many software applications.

### Key Concepts

- **Rows and Columns**: In a CSV file, rows represent individual records, while columns represent fields within those records. Each row contains the same number of columns, ensuring that data is consistently organized.
- **Comma Separation**: Fields within a record are separated by commas. If a field contains a comma, it can be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish the comma within the field from the delimiter.
