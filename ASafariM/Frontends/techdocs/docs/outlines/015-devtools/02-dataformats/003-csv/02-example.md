### A CSV Example

Below is an example of a simple CSV file that contains information about a set of books:

**books.csv:**

```csv
Title,Author,Year
"The Great Gatsby",F. Scott Fitzgerald,1925
"1984",George Orwell,1949
"To Kill a Mockingbird",Harper Lee,1960
```

In this example:
- The first line contains the column headers: `Title`, `Author`, and `Year`.
- Each subsequent line represents a book record, with fields separated by commas. For instance, "The Great Gatsby" is the title, "F. Scott Fitzgerald" is the author, and "1925" is the year of publication.
